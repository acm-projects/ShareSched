# ShareSched üìÖ
Have you ever wanted to compare schedules with a friend but found it too tedious to compare every little time, professor, and location? ShareSched is an app that allows you to upload a picture of a schedule and extract the key details from it. ShareSched can also find similarities in your schedule and your friend‚Äôs whether it‚Äôs location, professor, class section, or more! ScareSched is the app you need when schedule planning time comes up.


## MVP

 - User account with user authentication
 - My Schedule tab for user‚Äôs schedule
-   Friend Schedule‚Äôs tab for schedule of friends	 
- User is able to upload a picture of a schedule and user is able to take photo of schedule within the app
- Image to text conversion of schedule image to schedule
- Comparison feature to find similarities between 2 uploaded schedules
	- Percentage indicator of how similar 2 schedules are


## Stretch Goals
-   Implementation of Google Calendar API to take school schedule from ShareSched and put them on a user's schedule
	- [Google Calendar API](https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/guides/overview) 
-   Implementation of the RateMyProf API to provide further insight into a user's schedule	- https://github.com/tisuela/ratemyprof-api
-   Social aspect that allows you to find other people with the same class (i.e include discord link for a certain class)
- QR Code feature that allows users to compare schedules without taking a picture of the schedule
- Analytics tab that includes useful insights about the schedules
	- Ex: total time spent in class
